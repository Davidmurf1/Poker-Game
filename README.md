#ColorPoker

I created a poker variation game, which includes 6 cards of four colour variations. 
The object of the game is to achieve more colour cards then your apponent, in such a case you will win.
The counter will increase and the player with the highest number will be the winnner.

UX
I designed this game with poker players, myself and also people with no knowledge of poker in mind.
This take on poker is more simplified but maintains the methodology of poker making it easier for people with no knowledge and something new for experienced players.

Features

In this game I created six playing cards on the game board, of which two are for player one, two for the river cards and two for player two.
I created three buttons: deal, play and fold 
Deal will allocate four cards, two to player one and two to the river 
Play will allocate the final two cards to player two upon which it will be determined who the winner is
I also introduced a counter, which will be incremented each time a player wins a game
The player with the most wins after each session wins
If a player wishes to restart at any point he/she can press the fold button.
